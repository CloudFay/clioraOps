Output Formatters (Placeholder)

This module is reserved for output formatting utilities and decorators.
Currently, formatting is done inline in various modules.

Potential features to add here:
- Table formatters (ASCII tables, Markdown)
- Color and style decorators
- Output alignment utilities
- Progress bar generators
- Multi-column layout helpers

To implement: Extract formatting code from other modules and consolidate here.
See: ui/prompts.py for a working example of a focused UI module.
