"""
File Operations Utilities (Placeholder)

This module is reserved for common file operation utilities.
Currently, file operations are handled inline in various modules.

Potential features to add here:
- Safe file reading with encoding detection
- Recursive directory operations
- Temporary file management
- File permission utilities
- Path normalization helpers

To implement: Extract file operations from other modules and consolidate here.
See: utils/logger.py for a working example of a focused utility module.
