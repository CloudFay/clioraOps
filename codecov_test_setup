We are using GitHub Actions

Step 1: Output a Coverage report file in your CI
Select your language below to generate your coverage reports. If your language isn't listed, visit our supported languages doc
 for example repositories. Codecov generally supports XML and JSON formats.


we are using --> Pytest
Install requirements in your terminal:

pip install pytest pytest-cov

In a GitHub Action, run tests and generate a coverage report:

pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-report=xml

Step 2: Select an upload token to add as a secret on GitHub-optional

Repository token
Use it for uploading coverage reports in the clioraOps repository.

Step 3: add token as repository secret
Codecov requires a token to authenticate uploading your coverage reports. Organization admin required to access organization settings > secrets and variables > actions

CODECOV_TOKEN: "tell me when you want me to paste it"


Your organization secret in GitHub should look like this:

Step 4: Add Codecov to your GitHub Actions workflow yaml file
After tests run, this will upload your coverage report to Codecov:

- name: Upload coverage reports to Codecov
    uses: codecov/codecov-action@v5
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}


Your final GitHub Actions workflow for a project using Pytest could look something like this:

Step 5: merge to main or your preferred feature branch
Once merged to your default branch, subsequent pull requests will have Codecov checks and comments. Additionally, you'll find your repo coverage dashboard here. If you have merged, try reloading the page.
